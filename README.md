# Fork of check_dlink_dgs.py by 2016 By Christian Stankowic
Attention: this plugin does not work with DGS series D-Links.
Reason: The SNMP OIDs of DXS have changed.
This script is Python3 compatible and also supports monitoring of switch stacks. 

The original can be found at https://github.com/stdevel/check_dlink_dgs.
